# Plotting_Challenge

### Analysis

- After completion of this challenge, I noticed it took the mice that took Capomulin to develop larger tumors. 
- By the end of the trial, Capomulin had a very low average tumor size compared to the other drugs used. 
- The only drug that had an average tumor size smaller than Capomulin was the drug Ramicane. 
- As the mouse weighed more, the tumor size increased. 




For this challenge I had the help of a few classmates including the TA's, Andrew and Erin, as well as my tutor, Saad Khan. Bewteen the guidance from these individuals and google, chat GBT, and stackoverflow.com, I was able to understnad the assignment and process the different types of charts and graphs using different techniques.

This challenge really challenged me, but it was well worth it.
