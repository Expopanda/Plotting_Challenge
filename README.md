# Plotting_Challenge

For this challeng I had the help of a few classmates including the TA's, Andrew and Erin, as well as my tutor, Saad Khan. Bewteen the guidance from these individuals and google, chat GBT, and stackoverflow.com, I was able to understnad the assignment and process the different types of charts and graphs using different techniques.

This challenge really challenged me, but it was well worth it.
